Ti=RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES

0.sec=There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These risks, while very low, deserve careful thought and should still be contemplated prior to enrolling.

1.sec=This is not a treatment study and we do not expect any medical side effects from participating.

2.sec=Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable.  Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not want to answer.

3.sec=Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study.  This can make some people feel self-conscious.

4.sec=Be safe – just as you would not text while driving, do not fulfill study activities while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform the activities!

5.sec=We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of privacy.  This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research study data to respect your privacy.  However, even with removal of this information, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and/or attempt to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her. 

6.sec=Accidental public disclosure may occur due to unintended data breaches including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study.  In such a case, your data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes.

7.sec=Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan.

8.sec=Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.
