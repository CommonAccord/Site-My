1.Ti=What will you be asked to do?

1.0.sec=If you decide to join the study you will need to download the free study application on your mobile device, register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in this study.  Then, periodically we will ask you to answer questions and/or perform activities on your mobile phone. Your study data will include your responses to surveys and activities and some measurements from the phone itself about how you are moving and interacting with others.

1.1.Ti=Register to the study

1.1.sec=You will follow the prompts on the app to register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in this study. There will be an electronic consent process explaining the risks and benefits of using the app.  The registration will include entering your name, email address, other general information about yourself and answer few questions to verify your eligibility.  You can cancel the registration process at any time.

1.2.Ti=Health Surveys

1.2.1.sec=We will periodically ask you to answer questions about yourself, your medical history, and your current health.

1.2.2.sec=You may skip any questions that you do not wish to answer.

1.2.3.sec={SurveyDetails.sec}

1.2.xlist={1.2.sens}

1.2.=[Z/Sec/3]

1.3.Ti=Activities

1.3.1.sec=Occasionally we may ask you to perform specific activities while using your mobile phone and record sensor data directly from your phone.
1.3.2.sec=For example, you may be asked to type a short journal entry, which will then be shared and analyzed for typing speed and accuracy as well as word usage.

1.3.3.sec={ActivityDetails.sec}

1.3.xlist={1.3.sens}

1.3.=[Z/Sec/3]

1.3.2.sec=We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these activities and surveys.  You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) and you may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study. These surveys and activities should take you about {SurveyDuration.cl}. You can adjust the app settings to turn on and off sending data at any time.  Occasionally we may re-contact you to ask for your feedback about using the app and about the kind of questions included in the study.

2.Ti=What we will and will not do with the data?

2.1.Ti=Data processing

2.1.sec=We will electronically process your data and separate your account information (name, email, contact information, etc.) from your study data (your responses to surveys and the measurements from the phone itself when you perform activities). We will combine your coded study data (without your name) with those of other study participants.  The combined data will be transferred electronically to {StoragePlatform.Name.Full}, {Sponsor.Name.Full}’ computerized research platform for storage and analysis.

2.2.Ti=Use in research

2.2.sec=The research team will analyze the combined data and report findings back to the community through Blog or scientific publications.  Your coded study data (without your contact information) may also be used by other researchers and for research purposes beyond this study if you choose to share them more broadly.  The Principal Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the combined study data.
