EntityType=C-Corporation

0.1.sec=A C-Corporation is the most common type of corporation and almost all publicly traded companies are C-Corporations.

0.2.sec=A C-Corporation is legally its own person, meaning it exists as a separate entity from its owners and will exist forever unless formally dissolved.

Plus.1.Ti=Limited Liability for all shareholders/owners

Plus.1.sec=Shareholders are only responsible for the amount of debt, liability, and obligations up to the amount of their investment.

Plus.2.Ti=Flexible Capital Structure

Plus.2.sec=A C-Corporation has the most flexibility as far as capital structure.  C-Corporations, unlike LLCs or S-Corporations, can have different classes of shareholders—such as voting and non-voting stock, foreign shareholders.

Plus.3.Ti=Best for attracting venture capital

Plus.3.sec=A C-Corporation, unlike a LLC or S-Corp is not a pass-through entity for tax purposes, which means venture capital funds are allowed to invest.  VC funds may be prohibited by their fund documents in LLCs and S-Corps, because they are pass-through entities and the VC fund may become liable for taxes on unrelated business income if it did invest in an LLC or S-Corp.

Minus.1.Ti=Double taxation

Minus.1.sec=As noted above, because C-Corporations are not pass through entities, they will be taxed once on corporate profit and the dividends to shareholders will be taxed again.

Minus.2.Ti=Lots of Record Keeping

Minus.2.sec=Maintaining the limited liability shield requires the corporation to be very diligent in their record keeping—filing the articles of incorporation, adopting by-laws, electing a Board of Directors and having documented annual meetings.   All of this must be documented otherwise shareholders may lose their limited liability.  The record keeping process can also be expensive to maintain.
