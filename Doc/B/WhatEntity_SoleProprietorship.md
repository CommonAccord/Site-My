Minus.1.Ti=Unlimited liability

Minus.1.sec=Unlimited liability for debts and lawsuits is the biggest disadvantage.  This is especially problematic if you have assets such as a home, 401K plan, etc. and operate a business that could possibly have significant liability exposure.  For example, a restaurant owner would be personally liable for slip and fall for a wet floor or food poisoning lawsuit.  While I’ve occasionally heard arguments that liability insurance would cover these cases, the problem is that insurance companies do not make money by paying out money for claims.   A sole proprietor leaves their fate in the hands of an insurance examiner who will thoroughly examine the claim to see if the insurance company is actually obligated to pay out on the claim.

Minus.2.Ti=No Equity Distribution

Minus.2.sec=A sole proprietorship by nature is only one individual and therefore no equity can be distributed to employees or investors.

Minus.3.Ti=Business dies with Owner

Minus.3.sec=The business dies when the owner dies, moves on, or is incapacitated.
